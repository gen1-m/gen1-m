          I am Geni! When I was 10 years old, I first became interested in programming because I wanted to play games but couldn't buy them. That is how I got interested in hacking and programming and began exploring for ways to acquire what I wanted. In addition to teaching me essential technical skills, my experience with programming has also helped me develop soft skills that have aided me in my career. These abilities include critical thinking, problem-solving, adaptability, flexibility, time management, and work ethic. Currently, I'm continuing my journey by studying at Jacobs University Bremen for a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Robotics.
